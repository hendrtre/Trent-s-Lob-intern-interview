        Hello my name is Trent, and I want to become a Full Stack Software Engineer. 
        I understand that the word Full Stack is a very blanketed term to use so I 
        will explain myself. I enjoy the arts, technology, and building things. 
        To be able work on a project from start to end really gives me much joy and 
        satisfaction. Which means a web developer has been the best fit that I can 
        find for myself as a career that I can enjoy and I wish further to pursue. 
        As of right now I really want to perfect my Front-End development skills and 
        eventually be good enough to work the back end as well. I do like designing 
        UX/UI interfaces, but being able to have that in mind as I actually code and 
        build it as a real project is the kind of engineer, I want to become as of 
        right now. As the years go by eventually my vision for myself is to be well 
        rounded in both front and back end aspects with front-end as my focused 
        specialty.
      </p>
      <p>
        With my desires to become a well-rounded engineer with a specialty as a 
        Front-End developer is what I hope to learn the most from my internship. As 
        well as understanding how the work flow works in real world applications. I 
        want to know how a team of developers work, how they and individuals problem 
        solve, and how to improve my Software Engineering skills on real applications. 
        These are the main things I wish to learn from an internship, but the chance 
        to get real work experience is what I'm valuing the most right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        I appreciate the time taken to look over my application and I hope to hear 
        back from this position soon.
